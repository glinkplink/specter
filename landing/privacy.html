    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-01-11</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Specter: Beyond the Veil</strong>
      (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information you provide</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Text you enter</strong> (e.g. messages/questions in the “Commune”
        feature). These messages are sent to our backend to generate a response.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support communications</strong> (if you email us).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information collected automatically</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Purchase/subscription information</strong>: if you subscribe or
        restore purchases, purchase status and related identifiers are processed
        by Apple/Google and our subscription provider (<strong>RevenueCat</strong>).
        We use this to unlock premium features and restore access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local app preferences</strong>: we store certain settings on your
        device using local storage (for example, haptic intensity and free usage
        counters). This stays on your device unless you choose to share it with
        us for support.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Device sensors &amp; audio</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The App may access device sensors such as the
        <strong>magnetometer</strong> and <strong>accelerometer</strong> to power
        scanning-style features.
      </li>
      <li>
        The App plays audio effects/ambience locally on your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> upload raw sensor streams by default.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the App features (including generating responses).</li>
      <li>Enable subscriptions and determine premium access.</li>
      <li>Maintain free usage limits (where applicable).</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
      <li>Improve reliability and troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we share information</h2>
    <p>
      We share information with service providers only as needed to run the App,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Supabase</strong> (hosting/backend) to process App requests (for
        example, generating responses).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat</strong> (subscriptions) to process purchases and
        verify premium entitlements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple</strong> / <strong>Google</strong> (in-app purchases) as the
        platform payment processors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the App and
      for legitimate operational purposes (such as troubleshooting and handling
      subscription status). Local preferences stored on your device remain until
      you delete the App or clear its data.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can stop data collection by uninstalling the App.</li>
      <li>
        You can contact us to request access or deletion of information we may
        have associated with you (to the extent applicable).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly
      collect personal information from children under 13.
